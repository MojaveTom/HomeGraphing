GraphTemps.py is a python program to read home automation database files and plot the data.

RetrieveAmbientWeatherData.py is another program that reads weather data from Ambient Weather and stores it in a local database for quick access.

Both programs read a configuration file "secrets.ini" to access sensitive information.  Secrets.ini is not in the repository, but an example file: "ExampleSecrets.ini" is included.  "ExampleSecrets.ini" is provided primarily to define the keys that will be accessed by the programs.
